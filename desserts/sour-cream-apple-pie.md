http://www.lottieanddoof.com/2013/08/hoosier-mama/

##Ingredients

- 1 single-crust blind baked pie dough shell
- 2 cups apples, peeled, cored, and chopped into 1/2-inch pieces (I like Granny Smith)
- 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons granulated sugar
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla paste (feel free to sub extract)

####Walnut Struesel
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 3/4 cup finely chopped walnuts
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- pinch kosher salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted

##Directions

####Walnut Struesel
1. Combine the flour, walnuts, granulated sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt in a medium bowl.

2. Pour in the melted butter and mix with your fingers (or a fork) until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

####Pie
1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

2. Spread the apple pieces over the bottom of the pie shell. Place on a baking sheet and set aside.

3. Place the sugar, flour, and salt in a small bowl and whisk until well-combined.

4. Whisk together the sour cream, egg, and vanilla paste.

5. Add the dry ingredients and whisk until smooth. Pour into the prepared pie shell, over the apples. With a spatula, submerge any apples that float to the top.

6. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until the edge of the filling is slightly puffed and the center is dry to the touch.

7. When the pie is ready, gently scatter the streusel over the top of the pie and bake for 10 to 15 minutes more, until the streusel is crispy.

8. Cool to room temperature, then chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before slicing.
