## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 sticks unsalted butter (1 1/4 cups), more for greasing pan
- 200 grams chocolate wafer cookies (to make about 3 cups crumbs)
- 55 grams light brown sugar (about 1/4 cup)
- 3 grams fine sea salt (about 1/2 teaspoon), plus a pinch
- 2 ripe bananas, mashed
- 2 large eggs
- 455 grams dark brown sugar (about 2 1/2 cups)
- 2 tablespoons dark rum or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 130 grams all-purpose flour (about 1 cup)
- 80 grams toasted walnuts, chopped (about 1/2 cup)

## Directions

1. Heat oven to 375 degrees. Line a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with parchment, and grease with butter.

2. Melt 1 stick of butter in a saucepan over low heat or in microwave. Put the chocolate wafer cookies in the bowl of a food processor and process to make fine crumbs. Add the light brown sugar, melted butter and a pinch of salt. Process until the mixture is the consistency of damp sand. Dump the mixture into the pan and press it into an even layer. Bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the surface is firm. Remove the pan and set aside.

3. Reduce oven heat to 350 degrees.

4. In a large skillet over medium heat, melt 12 tablespoons butter, then let it cook until the foam subsides and butter turns a deep nut brown, about 5 minutes. Cool.

5. In a large bowl, whisk together bananas, eggs, dark brown sugar and rum. Whisk in brown butter. In a separate bowl, whisk together flour and fine salt. Fold into batter along with the toasted walnuts. Pour the mixture over the prepared crust and spread evenly.

6. Transfer pan to oven and bake until the top is firm and a toothpick inserted in the center emerges with a few crumbs attached (or clean) but not wet, 45 to 55 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack; cut into 24 bars.
