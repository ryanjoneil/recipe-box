http://supper.mx/recipes/spinach-gratin

## Ingredients

- 1 lb spinach (frozen, chopped)
- 2/3 cup heavy cream (and a little more, if needed to thin)
- 2 garlic cloves (minced)
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 1/4 cup parmesan cheese (grated)
- 1/4 cup Swiss cheese (grated)
- salt and pepper

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400Â°F.

2. Have spinach fully defrosted and wring out all excess water.

3. In large stock pot, melt butter, and lightly brown garlic. Add heavy cream and bring to a slow simmer. Season with salt and pepper.

4. Once cream is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes of simmering, add spinach.

5. Stir spinach in, and cook on low until warmed. Add a little more heavy cream if it seems too thick you want it to be loose, but not soupy.

6. Add parmesan cheese and taste for seasoning.

7. Transfer to a large baking dish and top with cheese.

8. Bake until cheese is golden and spinach is bubbling on the sides, about 20 minutes.
