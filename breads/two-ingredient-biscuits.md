# Two-Ingredient Buttermilk Biscuits
http://gardenandgun.com/blog/easiest-biscuits-youll-ever-make

## Ingredients

- 3 cups self-rising flour
- 1 1/2 cups high-quality whole buttermilk
- Melted butter, for topping
- Coarse salt, for topping (optional)

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 425°. 

2. Add flour to a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the center and pour in the buttermilk. Mix by moving your open hand along the side of the bowl, folding the flour into the buttermilk but taking care not the overwork the dough. Once it’s a shaggy mass, turn it out onto a floured surface and fold it until it comes together. Make one last fold and then punch out rounds using a biscuit cutter or a glass. 

3. Grease a baking sheet with butter or coat with non-stick cooking spray and place the biscuits on top, almost touching. Arrange any scraps around the sides, almost touching. As they rise, they’ll be walls that encourage the biscuits to grow upward, not out. 

4. Brush the tops of the biscuits with melted butter, sprinkle on salt, and bake for 15 minutes or until risen and lightly golden brown on top. Remove from the oven, brush with more butter, and serve immediately.
