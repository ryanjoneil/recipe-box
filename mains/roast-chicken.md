##Ingredients
- 3 to 4 pound chicken
- 1 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt per pound of chicken
- Fresh herbs

##Directions
1. At least eight hours before the chicken needs to be cooked, spatchcock it by cutting down both sides of the spine, removing it, and flattening the breast bone.

2. Rub chicken all over with kosher salt and herbs, under the skin where possible.

3. Place the chicken, skin side up, uncovered in the refrigerator for at least eight hours. This will allow the skin to dry out and crisp up in the oven.

4. Preheat oven to 500°F. Set wire rack in rimmed baking sheet lined with aluminum foil. Position chicken so that breasts are aligned with center of baking sheet and legs are close to edge. Roast until thickest part of breast close to bone registers 150 degrees on an instant-read thermometer and joint between thighs and body registers at least 170°F, about 45 minutes, reducing the heat to 450°F if the chicken starts to darken too quickly.
