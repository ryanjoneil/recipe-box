http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/02/no-holds-barred-lasagna-bolognese-pasta-italian-homemade-ricotta.html

## Ingredients
- 1 batch of [bolognese sauce](https://github.com/lesliepassante/recipe-box/blob/master/sauces/bolognese.md)
- 1 batch of homemade pasta, rolled out into #2 sheets

#### Ricotta Mixture
- 2 to 3 cups ricotta
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup minced basil or parsley (or a mix of both), OR 1 pound of chopped spinach, wilted and wrung dry

#### Besciamella
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons flour
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced, or grated on a microplane grater
- 2 cups whole milk
- 1/2 pound dry whole milk mozzarella cheese, grated
- 1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper

## Directions

#### Ricotta Mixture

1. Place ricotta in bowl of food processor or stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment and process/mix until smooth. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Add two eggs and minced herbs, and process/mix until incoroporated. Set aside at room temperature until ready to use.

#### Besciamella

2. Heat butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming subsides, stirring occasionally, about 1 minute. Add flour and stir with whisk until light blond in color and slightly nutty aroma develops, about 1 minute. Add garlic, and stir to combine. Whisking constantly, add milk in steady stream until fully incorporated. Bring to a simmer (mixture should thicken). Remove heat, add cheese and nutmeg, and whisk until fully melted. Whisking constantly, return to a simmer, remove from heat, and season to taste with salt and pepper. Set aside until ready to use.

#### Assemble

3. Adjust oven racks to lower middle and lowest positions and preheat oven to 375 degrees.

4. Add 1/6th of meat ragù (about 1 1/3 cups) to bottom of baking dish and drizzle with 1/2 cup besciamella. Place three noodles in single layer on top of sauce (noodles will not quite touch each other; this is okay). Top with 1/6 of meat sauce, 1/2 cup besciamella, 1/3 cup Parmigiano, and three more noodles. Spread 1/2 of ricotta mixture on top of noodles with rubber spatula, top with 1/6 of meat sauce, 1/3 cup parmigiano, and three more noodles. Top with 1/6 of meat sauce, 1/2 cup besciamella, 1/3 cup Parmigiano, and three more noodles. Spread remaining 1/2 of ricotta mixture on top of noodles with rubber spatula, top with 1/6 of meat sauce, 1/3 cup parmigiano, and three more noodles. Cover with remaining 1/6 of meat sauce, remaining besciamella (about 1 cup), and remaining 2/3 cup parmigiano. Baking dish should be very full at this point.

5. Place foil-lined rimmed baking sheet on lower rack to catch drips, then place lasagna on upper rack and bake until edges are starting to crisp, and top is a bubbly, golden brown, about 45 minutes, rotating half way through baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool at room temperature for 10 minutes. Sprinkle with herbs, and serve.
