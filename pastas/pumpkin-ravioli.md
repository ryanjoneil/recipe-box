http://www.mariobatali.com/recipes/pumpkin-lune-with-butter-and-sage/

##Ingredients
- 1 small kabocha or butternut squash (about 1 pound)
- 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
- 1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano, plus more for serving
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
- 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
- Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 1/2 half-batch of fresh pasta

##Directions

1. Cut the squash in half, remove the seeds, drizzle with olive oil, and place on a baking sheet. Roast for 25 to 35 minutes or until the squash is very soft. Remove from the oven, let cool, then scoop out the flesh from the skin.
 
2. In a large bowl, combine the cooled squash, cheese, nutmeg, balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper. Stir well to combine.
Roll out the pasta dough to the thinnest setting on a pasta machine. Using a biscuit cutter or water glass, cut out 2-inch circles. Pipe or carefully spoon a rounded tablespoon of filling onto the center of half of the rounds and over the filling with the second pasta round. Press the edges together firmly to seal.
 
3. Bring 6 quarts of water to a boil and add 2 tablespoons of salt. Drop the lune in the boiling water and cook for 2 minutes.
